# polyp_analysis

This repository contains diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) endoscopically derived perfusion markers of oxygen saturation, blood content and others, in a primary model
of colorectal cancer. 
The goal is to track how tumors respond over time to chemotherapy.
Disclaimer: the code in this repository is not very pretty and I am aware of that. This was the first project I did in R and back then I did not even know about the %>% operator and many functions. Still, I like to keep it like this to see how much my coding has improved (still working on it...)
